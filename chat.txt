Write a Chrome Extension.
Add popup page html of the chrome extension.
Add option page html of the chrome extension.

The extension will intercept what sites are allowed and if it's not allowed, redirect it to ./not-allowed.html?h=HOST page in the extension.

We're going to maintain a domain blacklist variable of domains. add 3 sample domains there.

We have to use a "before navigate" callback and intercept before even downloading and reaching the page. check domain against the blacklist.
